### **Findings and Severity Assessment**

#### **1. Cosmu Malware (Win.Malware.Cosmu & Win.Worm.Cosmu)**
- **Variants Detected:**
  - Win.Malware.Cosmu-10025820-0
  - Win.Worm.Cosmu-9958719-0 (Found twice)
  - Win.Malware.Cosmu-10018346-0
  - Win.Malware.Cosmu-9943629-0
- **Type:** Malware, Worm
- **Description:** The Cosmu family includes both malware and worms. Worm variants propagate through removable media and network shares, while malware variants may have keylogging, data exfiltration, and persistence capabilities.
- **Severity:** **High** – Worms can spread quickly and may lead to data loss or system compromise.

#### **2. Sagerunex Backdoor (Win.Backdoor.Sagerunex-10041857-1)**
- **Type:** Backdoor
- **Description:** Backdoor malware allows unauthorized remote access to the infected system. Attackers can use it to steal data, install additional malware, or control the system.
- **Severity:** **Critical** – Immediate action is necessary to remove and ensure no persistence mechanisms are left.

#### **3. Trojan Agent (Win.Trojan.Agent-6604307-0)**
- **Type:** Trojan
- **Description:** Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate programs but execute malicious actions such as stealing credentials, logging keystrokes, or providing remote access.
- **Severity:** **High** – Trojans are often used in targeted attacks and can compromise sensitive data.

#### **4. LodaRAT (Txt.Malware.LodaRAT-9978072-0)**
- **Type:** RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
- **Description:** LodaRAT is a remote access trojan known for stealing credentials, logging keystrokes, and allowing attackers to execute commands remotely.
- **Severity:** **High** – RATs provide complete control to an attacker, leading to severe security risks.

#### **5. Bladabindi (Win.Packed.Bladabindi-9880772-0)**
- **Type:** Packed Malware
- **Description:** Bladabindi is a known remote-access trojan (RAT) that steals information and grants control to attackers. It often uses packing techniques to evade detection.
- **Severity:** **Critical** – This malware is dangerous due to its ability to bypass security measures and execute malicious commands.

#### **6. Expiro Virus (Win.Virus.Expiro-9947081-0)**
- **Type:** File Infector Virus
- **Variants Detected:**
  - Win.Virus.Expiro-9947081-0 (Found twice)
- **Description:** Expiro is a polymorphic file-infecting virus that spreads by injecting malicious code into executable files, leading to file corruption and system instability.
- **Severity:** **High** – Can cause widespread damage to system files and applications.

#### **7. Runouce Worm (Win.Worm.Runouce-947)**
- **Type:** Worm
- **Description:** Worms like Runouce propagate through network shares and removable media, often causing performance degradation and unauthorized access.
- **Severity:** **Medium-High** – Worms can rapidly spread, though their impact varies based on their payload.

### **Recommended Actions**
1. **Immediate Quarantine & Removal**
   - Use ClamAV or another security tool to remove all detected threats.
2. **Check for System Compromise**
   - If the infected drive was connected to an active system, conduct a full security audit.
3. **Reinstall or Restore Affected Files**
   - Expiro virus may have infected critical executables; consider restoring from a clean backup.
4. **Monitor for Unauthorized Activity**
   - Since backdoors and RATs were found, monitor network activity and change all passwords.
5. **Secure the System**
   - Ensure all software is updated, and install a robust antivirus/firewall solution.
6. **Isolate the Infected Drive**
   - If possible, avoid connecting the infected drive to other systems until it is fully cleaned.

### **Conclusion**
The scan results indicate a significant infection with multiple malware types, including worms, trojans, backdoors, and viruses. The presence of RATs and backdoors suggests a high risk of remote exploitation. Immediate remediation is necessary to prevent further damage or data compromise.

**Severity: Critical** – Due to the presence of backdoors, RATs, and file-infecting viruses, the system should be considered compromised, and proper security measures should be taken to restore integrity.
